## Key Assumptions

1. **Format:** Medley-style performance (consistent with recent Super Bowls)
2. **Duration:** 12-14 minutes of performance time
3. **New Album:** "Debí Tirar Más Fotos" songs will be prominently featured
4. **No Repeats:** Songs from his 2020 Super Bowl appearance (with J.Lo/Shakira) are unlikely to repeat
5. **Guest Artists:** Limited or no guest appearances (logistics + time constraints)

## Caveats

- **Rehearsal Changes:** Setlists often change during rehearsals
- **Surprise Elements:** Super Bowl shows frequently include unexpected moments
- **Guest Appearances:** A surprise guest could alter song selection
- **Current Events:** Last-minute changes based on cultural moments
