## Honorable Mentions

Songs that narrowly missed the prediction but could appear:

| Song | Score | Live Performances | Why Not Selected |
|------|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| El apagón | 93% | 76 | Lower ensemble score than selected songs |
| Si veo a tu mamá | 93% | 94 | Lower ensemble score than selected songs |
| Efecto | 92% | 99 | Lower ensemble score than selected songs |

## Key Assumptions

1. **Format:** Medley-style performance (consistent with recent Super Bowls)
2. **Duration:** 12-14 minutes of performance time
3. **New Album:** "Debí Tirar Más Fotos" songs will be prominently featured
4. **No Repeats:** Songs from his 2020 Super Bowl appearance (with J.Lo/Shakira) are unlikely to repeat
5. **Guest Artists:** Limited or no guest appearances (logistics + time constraints)

## Caveats

- **Rehearsal Changes:** Setlists often change during rehearsals
- **Surprise Elements:** Super Bowl shows frequently include unexpected moments
- **Guest Appearances:** A surprise guest could alter song selection
- **Current Events:** Last-minute changes based on cultural moments

| Dákiti | MEDIUM | #N/A | Crossover hit, widely expected |
| El Apagón | MEDIUM | #N/A | High cultural significance |

---

## What to Watch For

### Guest Artist Predictions

| Artist | Likelihood | Potential Song | Why |
|--------|------------|----------------|-----|
| Cardi B | HIGH | 'I Like It' | Already at venue, minimal coordination needed |
| J Balvin | MEDIUM | 'Oasis tracks or I Like It' | Rehearsal sightings, social media hints |
| Daddy Yankee | MEDIUM | 'La santa' | Rehearsal sightings, social media hints |
| Residente | LOW-MEDIUM | 'Unknown' | Rehearsal sightings, social media hints |
| Rosalía | LOW-MEDIUM | 'La noche de anoche' | Rehearsal sightings, social media hints |
| Drake | LOW | 'MIA' | Rehearsal sightings, social media hints |

### Potential Surprises

| Element | Likelihood | What It Could Mean |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Puerto Rico Tribute | HIGH | Cultural/political moment during El Apagón or NUEVAYoL |
| New Music Debut | LOW | Possible new single announcement |
| Dancer/Choreography Spectacle | HIGH | Trailer emphasized dancing - expect major choreography |

### Key Uncertainties

1. **Guest Artists**: No guests officially confirmed; Cardi B most likely given boyfriend in game
2. **Song Order**: Trailer suggests dancing theme but actual sequence unknown
3. **Medley vs Full Songs**: Unknown how many songs will be snippets vs full performances
4. **Political Moments**: El Apagón has political themes - unclear if NFL will allow full message
5. **Technical Production**: Stage design could influence song selection

### Pre-Show Checklist

Before February 8, monitor for:
- [ ] Official setlist leaks from rehearsals
- [ ] Guest artist arrivals in Santa Clara
- [ ] Social media hints from Bad Bunny's accounts
- [ ] Stage design/prop photos from Levi's Stadium
- [ ] Last-minute song announcements
- [ ] Dancer/choreography reveals
- [ ] **Cardi B sightings at Levi's Stadium rehearsals** ⭐

## 🃏 Wild Card Scenario: Cardi B Appearance

### New Intel (January 30, 2026)
**Stefon Diggs (Patriots WR) is CONFIRMED playing in Super Bowl LX.**

This means **Cardi B will already be at Levi's Stadium** to support her boyfriend — dramatically increasing the likelihood of a guest appearance.

### Impact on "I Like It"

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Original Status** | Deprioritized (performed at SB 2020) |
| **New Status** | 🔥 WATCH LIST - HIGH |
| **Logistics** | ✅ Cardi already at venue, minimal coordination |
| **Song Stats** | 89 live performances, #1 Billboard Hot 100 |
| **Cultural Weight** | First female rapper with multiple #1s, 1B+ video views |

### If "I Like It" Is Added

**Expected setlist adjustment:**

| Position | Current Pick | Wild Card Scenario |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | BAILE INoLVIDABLE | BAILE INoLVIDABLE |
| 2 | Yo perreo sola | Yo perreo sola |
| 3 | Amorfoda | Amorfoda |
| 4 | Chambea | Chambea |
| 5 | Si estuviésemos juntos | Si estuviésemos juntos |
| 6 | NUEVAYoL | NUEVAYoL |
| 7 | Soy peor | Soy peor |
| 8 | La santa | La santa |
| 9 | Me porto bonito | **I Like It** 🆕 (w/ Cardi B) |
| 10 | Estamos bien | ~~Estamos bien~~ (bumped) |

**Why this works:**
- "I Like It" is a natural crowd-pleaser with massive crossover appeal
- The 2020 performance was brief (medley segment) — a 2026 version could be more prominent
- Having Cardi on stage creates a viral moment and validates Bad Bunny's mainstream status
- J Balvin (also on original track) could potentially join, making it a reunion

### Counter-Arguments

1. **Repeat Performance**: NFL may want fresh content, not SB 2020 callback
2. **Time Constraint**: Adding a guest takes stage time for transitions
3. **Bad Bunny's Vision**: He may want a fully Spanish-language show
4. **Daddy Yankee Priority**: If only one guest, La santa with Daddy Yankee may be preferred

### Likelihood Assessment

| Scenario | Probability |
|----------|-------------|
| Cardi B appears with "I Like It" | **35%** (up from 10%) |
| No guest appearances | 40% |
| Daddy Yankee appears (La santa) | 20% |
| Other guest (J Balvin, Rosalía) | 5% |
